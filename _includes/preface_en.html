<p>I was born in the city of Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod), USSR. I published my first paper more than 50 years ago, being a student of the Mathematical Department of Voronezh State University. At that time, under the supervision of prof. B.N. Sadovsky, and later prof. M.A. Krasnosel'skii, I became interested in theories of measures of non-compactness, hysteresis and bifurcations. Later I "switched" to the problems of stability of asynchronous systems. Now my interests also include studying the stability of systems in various classes of desynchronization, studying the influence of controllability-type properties on transient processes in asynchronous systems, as well as the influence of time/spatial discretization on the dynamics of continuous systems, applications of the stability theory of asynchronous systems to the analysis of the dynamics of data transmission networks and asynchronous neural networks. In the last 20 years, I have focused on studying the problem of joint/generalized spectral radius for a family of linear operators. I am the author of 3 monographs, about 200 articles and conference talks.</p>
